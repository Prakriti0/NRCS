<p>
        A single donation can save three lives. One blood donation provides different blood components that
         can help up to three different people. Blood banking refers to the process of collecting, separating,
          and storing blood. Blood banks collect blood and separate it into its various components so they can 
          be used most effectively according to the needs of the patient. The donor usually gives one pint of 
          whole blood. The blood is tested for blood type and infectious disease (HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C
           and Syphilis), and then the blood is separated into its components red blood cells, plasma and platelets.
            The stock blood is then crossmatched with patients blood before transfusion.
        
        Blood donation is safe. New, disposable equipment is used for each donor, so there's no risk of 
        contracting a bloodborne infection by donating blood. Within 24 hours of a blood donation, your 
        body replaces the lost fluids. And after several weeks, your body replaces the lost red blood cells
        . Health benefits of donating blood include good health and reduced risk of cancer and hemochromatosis.
         It helps in reducing the risk of damage to liver and pancreas. Donating blood may help in improving 
         cardiovascular health and reducing obesity.

        You need to prepare your body. It is important to eat iron-rich foods such as red meats, fish, beans
         and spinach, drink plenty of water the two days prior to donating, get a good sleep and eat a healthy 
         meal two hours before your donation.

       <h3 style="text-align: center;">About Blood</h3> 
        <br>
        Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that has many different functions, including:
        
            transporting oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues
        
            forming blood clots to prevent excess blood loss
        
            carrying cells and antibodies that fight infection
        
            bringing waste products to the kidneys and liver, which filter and clean the blood
        
            regulating body temperature
        
        
        <br><br>There are four blood groups: A, B, AB and O and two types of RH factor: Positive and Negative.
